## Analysing request
To analyse the traffics between the app and psa server, you can use mitmproxy.
You will need the client certificate present in the apk at asssets/MWPMYMA1.pfx
```bash
# decrypt the pfx file (there is no password)
openssl pkcs12 -in MWPMYMA1.pfx -out MWPMYMA1.pem -nodes
```
Then you can use mitmproxy for example:

```
mitmproxy --set client_certs=MWPMYMA1.pem
```

For being able to see traffic from the android app you need a rooted phone, you can use an android emulator then follow this:
